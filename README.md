# Master Repo Subtree Test

This is a test of combining separate repositories as a single master repository
which references branches of the slave as folders for easy navigation across
multiple repositories. This test uses subtree to reference branches from
slave repositories.

## Branches

- [`day-1`]()
- [`day-2`]()
- [`day-3`]()
- [`day-4`]()
